He previously captained in T20 matches and in the country's 2024 T20 World Cup win after which he retired from T20s in June. He is considered as one of the best batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest white-ball opening batters of all time. \n",
      "He holds several batting records which famously include most runs in T20 Internationals, most sixes in international cricket, most double centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World Cups (7) and joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). He is the first player to score 5 T20I centuries. He also holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019.
